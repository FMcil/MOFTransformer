# MOFformer
- `MOfformer` is a multi-modal pretraining Transformer that is designed to enable universal transfer learning (UTL) in Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs).

## Introduction
![fig1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64190846/167797065-1a104b35-a949-4775-93d4-c7310d90afbb.jpg)

- `MOFformer` was trained with 1 M hypothetical MOFs (hMOFs) generated by [pormake](https://github.com/Sangwon91/PORMAKE) in the pretraining step. 
- The goal of pretrainig is to learn `local features` and `global features` in MOFs
  - local features : Metal node, Organic linker, Functional groups, etc.
  - global features : Topology, Pore volume, Surface area, etc.

- The pretraining tasks are as belows:

1) MTP (MOF Topology Prediction)
2) MOC (Metal node/Organic linker Classification)
3) VFP (accessible Void Fraction Prediction)


## Architectures

- `MOFformer` takes two different representations as input
1) Atom-based Graph Representation : CGCNN w/o pooling layer -> local features
2) 3D Structural Image Representation : 1D flatten patches of 3D energy grid -> global features





## Finetuning Results
